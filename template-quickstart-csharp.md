Title: 
    The H1 of your Quickstart should be in the format: # Quickstart: [Product Name] client library for [Language]
-->

# Quickstart: [Product Name] client library for .NET

Get started with the [Product Name] client library for .NET. Follow these steps to install the package and try out the example code for basic tasks.

<!-- 
    After the above line, briefly describe the service. You can often use the first line of the service's docs landing page for this.

    Next, add a bulleted list of the most common tasks supported by the library, prefaced with "Use the [Product Name] client library for [Language] to:". You provide code snippets for these tasks in the Code examples section later in the Quickstart. Keep the list short but include those tasks most developers need to perform with the library.

    Lastly, include the following single line of links targeting the library's companion content at the bottom of the introduction; make adjustments as necessary, for example NuGet instead of PyPi:

<!--
    Include the following single line of links targeting the library's companion content at the bottom of the introduction; make adjustments as necessary, but try not to include any other links or content in the introduction.

[Reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.AnomalyDetector?view=azure-dotnet-preview) | [Library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/master/sdk/cognitiveservices/AnomalyDetector) | [Package (NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.AnomalyDetector/) | [Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/anomalydetector)

## Prerequisites

* Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services/)
* The [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or current version of [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).
<!-- this <a> link opens the Azure portal in a new tab/window. Replace the link with one to your service's resource create blade-->
* Once you have your Azure subscription, <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics"  title="Create a [Product Name] resource"  target="_blank">create a [Product Name] resource <span class="docon docon-navigate-external x-hidden-focus"></span></a> in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint. Wait for it to deploy and click the **Go to resource** button.
    * You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect your application to [Product Name]. You'll paste your key and endpoint into the code below later in the quickstart.
    * You can use the free pricing tier (`F0`) to try the service, and upgrade later to a paid tier for production.
    


## Setting up

<!--
    Walk the reader through preparing their environment for working with the client library. Include instructions for creating the Azure resources required to make calls to the service, obtaining credentials, and setting up their local development environment.

    See the "setting up" section for more details: 
    https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/help/contribute/contribute-how-to-write-library-quickstart-v2?branch=pr-en-us-2187#setting-up -->

### Create a new C# application

<!--
Use your knowledge of your audience to determine whether CLI and/or Visual Studio instructions are best suited for your quickstart.
-->

#### [Visual Studio IDE](#tab/visual-studio)

Using Visual Studio, create a new .NET Core application. 

### Install the client library 

Once you've created a new project, install the client library by right-clicking on the project solution in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Manage NuGet Packages**. In the package manager that opens select **Browse**, check **Include prerelease**, and search for `[package-name]`. Select version `[version]`, and then **Install**. 

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

In a console window (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Bash), use the `dotnet new` command to create a new console app with the name `(product-name)-quickstart`. This command creates a simple "Hello World" C# project with a single source file: *Program.cs*.

```console
dotnet new console -n (product-name)-quickstart
```

Change your directory to the newly created app folder. You can build the application with:

```console
dotnet build
```

The build output should contain no warnings or errors. 

```console
...
Build succeeded.
 0 Warning(s)
 0 Error(s)
...
```

### Install the client library 

Within the application directory, install the [Product Name] client library for .NET with the following command:
<!-- consider displaying the --version parameter to prevent code breakages after library updates -->
```console
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.[Product Name] --version x.y
```


---

> [!TIP]
> Want to view the whole quickstart code file at once? You can find it on [GitHub](), which contains the code examples in this quickstart.

From the project directory, open the *program.cs* file and add the following `using` directives:

```csharp
using ...
using ...
```

In the application's **Program** class, create variables for your resource's key and endpoint.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Go to the Azure portal. If the [Product name] resource you created in the **Prerequisites** section deployed successfully, click the **Go to Resource** button under **Next Steps**. You can find your key and endpoint in the resource's **key and endpoint** page, under **resource management**. 
>
> Remember to remove the key from your code when you're done, and never post it publicly. For production, consider using a secure way of storing and accessing your credentials. See the Cognitive Services [security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-security) article for more information.



```csharp
private static readonly AzureKeyCredential credentials = new AzureKeyCredential("<replace-with-your-[product-name]-key-here>");
private static readonly Uri endpoint = new Uri("<replace-with-your-[product-name]-endpoint-here>");
```

In the application's **Main** method, add calls for the methods used in this quickstart. You will implement these later.

<!-- 
    Be sure the main method calls the example task functions in this quickstart. The inline comment helps inform customers to implement the quickstart methods, in case they initially see "undefined method" errors.
-->

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args){
    // You will create the below methods later in the quickstart
    exampleTask1();
}
```

## Object model

<!-- 
    Briefly introduce and describe the functionality of the library's main classes. Include links to their reference pages.
    Briefly explain the object hierarchy and how the classes work together to manipulate resources in the service.
-->

The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the [Product Name] .NET SDK.

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
| | |

## Code examples

<!--
    Include code snippets and short descriptions for each task you list in the the bulleted list. Briefly explain each operation, but include enough clarity to explain complex or otherwise tricky operations.

    Include links to the service's reference content when introducing a class for the first time
-->

These code snippets show you how to do the following tasks with the [Product Name] client library for .NET:

* [Authenticate the client](#)
* [Example task 1 (anchor link)](#)
* [Example task 2 (anchor link)](#)
* [Example task 3 (anchor link)](#)

## Authenticate the client

<!-- 
    The authentication section (and its H3) is required and must be the first code example in the section if your library requires authentication for use.
-->

In a new method, instantiate a client with your endpoint and key. Create an [ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials]() object with your key, and use it with your endpoint to create an [ApiClient]() object.

```csharp

```

## Example task 1

Example: Create a new method to read in the data and add it to a [Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) object as an array of [Points](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). Send the request with the [send()](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) method

```csharp

```

<!-- 
    Show the application output from each task, if output exists
    If this code sample is in a function, tell the reader to call it. For example:

    Call the `example()` function.

-->

## Example task 2

Example: Create a new method to read in the data and add it to a [Request](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) object as an array of [Points](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). Send the request with the [send()](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/) method

```csharp

```

## Run the application

#### [Visual Studio IDE](#tab/visual-studio)

Run the application by clicking the **Debug** button at the top of the IDE window.

#### [CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the application from your application directory with the `dotnet run` command.

```dotnet
dotnet run
```

## Clean up resources

If you want to clean up and remove a Cognitive Services subscription, you can delete the resource or resource group. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
